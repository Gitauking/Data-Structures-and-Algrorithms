# ðŸ§  Data Structures and Algorithms (Python)

This repository contains beginner-friendly implementations of **essential data structures and algorithms** using Python. The goal is to understand the logic behind each algorithm with simple code and clear explanations â€” as if you're learning it for the first time!

## âœ… What's Included

### ðŸŸ¢ Sorting Algorithms:
1. **Bubble Sort**  
   Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

2. **Selection Sort**  
   Finds the minimum element and moves it to the front, one step at a time.

3. **Merge Sort**  
   A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the list, sorts each half, and merges them.

---

### ðŸ”µ Searching Algorithms:
1. **Linear Search**  
   Looks through each item one by one to find a match.

2. **Binary Search**  
   Efficiently finds elements in a sorted list by cutting the list in half each step.

## ðŸ’¡ Why Learn These?

These algorithms are the **foundation of computer science**. Understanding how they work helps you:

- Think logically and solve problems efficiently.
- Write code that is optimized for performance.
- Prepare for coding interviews and technical assessments.
- Understand how things like Google Search, file systems, and databases work under the hood.

## ðŸš€ Why These Algorithms Are Fundamental

> "Algorithms are to computer science what recipes are to cooking." â€” They tell the computer exactly what steps to follow to get a result.

### ðŸ“Œ Here's why they matter:
- Sorting and searching are used in **almost every software system** (from search engines to banking apps).
- They improve **efficiency and performance**, especially with large amounts of data.
- They help build strong **problem-solving skills** and are often asked in interviews.
